**Quasi-connectivity** is behaviour when an object gets powered by space on top that is powered. The object doesn't get block update and does not activate until it receives one. This behaviour is often used in TMC and many redstone contraptions use it. The behaviour is [working as intended](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-108) and is not likely to be changed in the near future.   

## List of objects that get powered by QC:
* piston
* sticky piston
* dropper
* dispenser
