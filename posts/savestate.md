Chunk save-state is a bug found by Xcom, Skyrising and Earthcomputer. It's used to make larger portals or dupe items. This bug is based on overloading the chunk with data, if the chunk size goes over 1MB it won't save. The most common way to overload a chunk is with books that have lot of different characters making them take up a lot of data. It's possible to get book-banned if you have too many of them in your inventory. Mojang patched the save-state bug in version 1.15.0 for being a dupe exploit.
