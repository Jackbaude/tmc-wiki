## History

## Projects

Hekate has some remarkable projects that are some of the best in the community. The [slime farm](https://youtu.be/7ozBe803k78) is the fastest slime farm in minecraft. Other projects that have been monumental have been the [end cannon](https://youtu.be/NRZgujUiseU) which got to the end world border in about 24 hours. Additionally the server has developed ways to [suppress players](https://youtu.be/091mFU3d8m0) , in order to make a portal link to the world border.

The server has a total of 5 RNG farms including, slime, witch, pigman, golem, and Ice spike generation farm. The server is still in its early ages and is eager to build more projects.
## Server details
Derpapottamus himself owns and runs the server from his home, along side the cmp and backup servers. The server runs on carpet server, which is developed by one of the members Xcom6000.

While the server runs on carpet mod, the server votes on features to allow such as easy place or careful break. The server dupes gravity blocks, and has a recipe for elytra.
